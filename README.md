Boilerplate for building pipelines using make
=============================================

Using `make` is a convenient way to build bioinformatics pipelines. However it is often practical to store the files generated by the pipeline
outside the repository (potentially on a different file system). This pipeline skeleton contain a minimal layout with some utility make targets and handles the creation anddestruction of the working directory. To keep things simple it does not try to package the pipeline as a python module.

Usage
-----

Edit `config.mk` and issue `make <target>` to invoke the target of your choice.

Python dependencies
-------------------

See `requirements.txt` for other dependencies. Use `make dep` to install them.

Application dependencies
------------------------

Layout
------

* `README.md`
* `Makefile`          - master makefile
* `config.mk`         - makefile for general configuration
* `analysis.mk`       - makefile for pipeline steps
* `utils.mk`          - utility makefile
* `scripts/`          - analysis scripts
* `lib/`              - python files included by analysis scripts
* `data/`             - input data needed by pipeline - use with caution to avoid bloated repo
* `results/`          - pipeline results to be commited - use with caution to avoid bloated repo
* `requirements.txt`  - list of python package dependencies

Useful make targets
-------------------

```
wdir                    create working directory
clean_wdir              delete working directory. WARNING: all data will be lost!
info                    print pipeline info
com                     commit all changes
dep                     install python dependencies using pip
```
